# aws-terraform-aurora

This module creates an aurora RDS cluster.  The module currently supports the aurora, aurora-mysql, and aurora-postgres engines.

The module will output the required configuration files to enable client and worker node setup and configuration.

## Basic Usage

```HCL
module "aurora_master" {
  source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-aurora//?ref=v0.12.1"

  binlog_format = "MIXED"
  engine        = "aurora"

  instance_availability_zone_list = [
    "us-west-2a",
    "us-west-2b",
    "us-west-2c",
  ]

  instance_class    = "db.t2.medium"
  name              = "sample-aurora-master"
  password          = "${data.aws_kms_secrets.rds_credentials.plaintext["password"]}"
  replica_instances = 2
  security_groups   = ["${module.vpc.default_sg}"]
  storage_encrypted = true
  subnets           = "${module.vpc.private_subnets}"
}
```
